    In this modern age the farmer does not even have to be inside the field to gather his animals. The farmer can now be at home at his desk flying a drone to gather his flock of sheep. 
    <p></p>
    With good control reaction the drone is agile enough to keep up with any animal. A farmer can elevate the aircraft to 500m in the air and see more the 10km in the direction he chooses. So now it is much easier to find a flock in a big area. Saving time and energy and even money as the drone does have a long time waranty and can be insured.
